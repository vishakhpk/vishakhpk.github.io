I am a first year PhD Student at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) where I am advised by [Prof. He He](https://hhexiy.github.io/). My research is broadly in the field of natural language processing and machine learning. I'm currently working on text generation for creative writing tasks and in interactive settings. 

Prior to this, I completed my MS in Computer Science at NYU's [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/) during which I was a Graduate Research Associate at the [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/) working on political stance classification and multimodel content sharing in online disinformation campaigns. I also interned at [LAER.AI](http://laer.ai/) in New York City where I did some work on unstructured document retrieval and active learning. 

I did my undergrad at the [National Institute of Technology - Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) where my thesis was advised by [Prof. Sowmya Kamath](https://infotech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/sowmya-kamath-s).

Here's my ![CV](./assets/img/cv.pdf)
