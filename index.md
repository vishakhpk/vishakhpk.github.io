title: Hi, I'm Vishakh 
---
I am a fourth year PhD Student at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) where I am advised by [Prof. He He](https://hhexiy.github.io/). My research is broadly in the field of natural language processing and human-AI collaboration. I'm currently working on collaborative text generation for creative writing tasks and other interactive settings. I also help organize the [NYU NLP and Text-as-Data](https://cds.nyu.edu/text-data-speaker-series/) talk series. 

Prior to this, I completed my MS in Computer Science at NYU's [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/) during which I was a Graduate Research Associate at the [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/) working on political stance classification and multimodel content sharing in online disinformation campaigns. I've also had the chance to intern with AWS, Amazon Alexa AI and LAER.AI while in grad school.

I did my undergrad at the [National Institute of Technology - Karnataka](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) where my thesis was advised by [Prof. Sowmya Kamath](https://infotech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/sowmya-kamath-s).

Here's my [list of publications](https://vishakhpk.github.io/publications/), [CV](./assets/img/cv.pdf) and [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OeBKZ8AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Head over to my [personal blog](https://paddyspen.wordpress.com/) for more light hearted content. All the other relevant links are in the footer. You can contact me at <vishakh@nyu.edu>.
